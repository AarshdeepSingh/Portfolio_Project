            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>Hello, everyone! I'm Aarshdeep Singh, a 20-year-old enthusiast from the beautiful city of Patiala, India, diving into the world of web development with a mix of passion and curiosity.Starting my journey back in high school, where I aced subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science, I stumbled upon the fascinating realm of web development. And guess what? I fell in love with it!</p>

            <p>While everyone's talking about AI taking over, I believe in keeping the human touch alive. Sure, AI's cool, but nothing beats our own creativity and empathy, That's why I'm on a mission to blend AI with our human spark, making web experiences that really speak to people.Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities. Landing a job in the field is my next big goal, and I can't wait to dive in and make a difference.</p>
