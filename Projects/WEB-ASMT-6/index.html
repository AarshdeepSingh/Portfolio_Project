                <p>One of the film’s standout features is its opening sequence — an aerial shot of Chambal, a village reminiscent of Sindh’s Katcha area, known for its history of dacoits. Anant Joshi’s voiceover, declaring “Yeh hai Chambal, haan wohi dakuon wala Chambal,” immediately establishes a privileged perspective for the audience. However, Chopra skillfully takes us from an etic view to the level of the protagonist, Manoj Kumar Sharma, played by Vikrant Massey.</p>

                <p>The film masterfully evokes empathy through its cinematography. The scenes depicting Manoj Kumar’s struggles, from being broke and finding his first job at a library to cleaning a toilet, make the audience feel the weight of his hardships. A poignant moment arises when Pritam Joshi, living a life of luxury due to his father’s wealth, tarnishes Manoj’s relationship with Shraddha. This scene is a powerful commentary on societal dynamics and privilege.</p>

                <p>“12th Fail” is not just a movie; it’s a lesson in filmmaking. From the atmospheric ambiance and captivating music to the stellar acting performances, particularly Vikrant Massey’s, this film deserves acclaim. Massey’s portrayal rivals the best in the industry, making this movie a potential addition to film courses for undergraduates.
                In conclusion, “12th Fail” offers more than just a cinematic experience. It provides valuable lessons in self-learning, skill development, and resilience. The characters, such as Ghauri, add depth to the narrative, contributing to the film’s richness. In my rating, “12th Fail” earns a solid 9/10, simply because it captivated me to the extent that I couldn’t blink. It’s a cinematic masterpiece that transcends conventional standards, leaving an enduring impact on the viewer.</p>
